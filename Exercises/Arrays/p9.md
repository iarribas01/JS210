The output statements on lines 11 and 12 output `false` when
we probably expect these lines to output `true`.

This is because we are using the strict equality operator `===`
to compare two arrays with each other. Unlike a scenario where
both operands are primitive data types, both operands happen to be
arrays, which are objects. When the strict equality operator
compares two objects, it checks whether two objects are referencing
the same object, not if the contents of the object are the same.

Therefore, while the contents of the arrays are identical, the two
arrays are not the same array.
