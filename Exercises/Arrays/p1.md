Line 6 will log `[1, 2, 3]` and line 10 will log `[1, 2, 3]`.

This is because on line 2, we initialize the constant `myOtherArray`
to point to the same object that `myArray` is pointing to using
variable assignment. We call a destructive method on both
objects on line 4, so we see the change reflected in the object that
both variables are pointing to.

On line 10 however, the objects that `myArray` and `myOtherArray` are
no longer the same. This is because we assigned `myArray` to a new object
on line 8 while `myArray` is still pointing to the original object.
